Why hello, name's Eyes, though you can also call me Ozni, Villian, or Carmine. I enjoy anything I find amusing, though I particularly enjoy drawing, daydreaming, Sudoku, D&D, games of various kinds, and making people afraid of me.
Though I relish in the misery of others and am definitely a psychopath of some variety, don't think that it keeps me from wanting to make friends, I quite enjoy the company of people as I find most things entertaining.
I'm fairly new to the internet, so I don't really know what I'm doing here, so don't be surprised if I make a lot of mistakes or generally lack knowledge.
I like video games such as Elder Scrolls, Cookie Run: Kingdom, as well as many horror and survival games. I also like playing Uno, Scrabble, Chess, and pretty much any board game under the sun as long as it isn't too complex.
My favorite music group is the Pochonbo Electronic Ensemble and my favorite musician is Tom Lehrer. My favorite comics are Dai Dark, FFF-Class Trash Hero, I Used to Be a Boss, Dungeon Odyssey,& Skeleton Soldier.
I like my coffee dark and my other favorite drinks are whiskey, gin, and Penafiel strawberry soda. I dislike most food on the sweeter side, stuffy/small places, not having many things to do, and loosing the people close to me.
While I tend to have a horrible personality and usually act only out of my own interests withvthe moral compass of a murderer, I am very friendly and will not treat you too bad as long as we're on neutral or good terms, even better if we're friends.
I treat others how they treat me, I'm just here to have fun anyways, so it doesn't matter too much in the end.
Looking for me elsewher? Of course you are. Just look to my <a href="https://redeyessv.carrd.co/">Carrd</a> for more. I'm all over the place, you jsut have to look
